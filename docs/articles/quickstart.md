# Quick Start

## What `framedf` Does

`framedf` is a first-pass diagnostic for an unfamiliar data frame. It
tries to read the data the way a careful colleague would — by figuring
out what each column means, by noticing pairs of columns that move
together, and by flagging values that look wrong.

The result is qualitative. You get sentences like *“temperature
decreases strongly with elevation”*, not Pearson coefficients. Numeric
evidence is still on the object for anyone who wants it; the printed
view stays calm.

There is one entry point,
[`frame()`](https://gillescolling.com/framedf/reference/frame.md), and
four reader functions:

- `print(frame(df))` — narrative overview.

- `relationships(frame(df))` — pairs grouped as meaningful, suspicious,
  structural, or ignored.

- `anomalies(frame(df))` — per-column oddities.

- `details(frame(df))` — methods, roles, skipped rules, backend.

## Installation

``` r

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("gcol33/framedf")
```

## A First Look

``` r

set.seed(1)
n <- 300L
df <- data.frame(
  plot_id    = sample(1:60, n, replace = TRUE),
  year       = sample(2010:2020, n, replace = TRUE),
  latitude   = stats::runif(n, 40, 50),
  longitude  = stats::runif(n, 5, 15),
  elevation  = stats::runif(n, 0, 2500),
  observer   = sample(letters[1:6], n, replace = TRUE),
  country    = sample(c("AT", "DE", "CH"), n, replace = TRUE),
  richness   = NA_real_,
  cover_a    = stats::runif(n, 0, 1),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
df$temperature <- 20 - df$elevation / 200 + stats::rnorm(n)
df$richness    <- 5 + 0.4 * sqrt(stats::runif(n, 1, 100)) +
                  2 * (df$observer == "a") + stats::rnorm(n)
df$cover_b     <- 1 - df$cover_a
```

``` r

fd <- frame(df)
print(fd)

```

The four sections of the print output map onto the four parts of any
first-look conversation:

- **Structure** — what kind of dataframe is this? How is it shaped, what
  identifies a row, what is the temporal/spatial axis?

- **Relationships** — what moves with what? Which patterns are real and
  which feel like artefacts?

- **Anomalies** — what looks wrong?

- **Ignored** — what was excluded from screening, and why?

#> drift checks: simple linear fits of spatial coordinates against time
```

[`details()`](https://gillescolling.com/framedf/reference/details.md) is
the place to go when an output surprises you. It tells you which mode
the screening ran in, what role each column was given, which rules
caused some pairs to be skipped, and whether the C++ backend was used.

## Adjust for a Confounder

If you suspect one variable is confounding most of the others, you can
partial it out before screening:

``` r

fd_adj <- frame(df, adjustment = "elevation")
relationships(fd_adj, kind = "meaningful")
#> Relationships
#> 
#> meaningful
#> ────────────────
#> cover_b ~ cover_a
#>   direction: negative
#>   strength: strong
#>   stability: high
#>   method: numeric screening (adjusted)
#> 
#> richness ~ observer
#>   pattern: group effect
#>   strength: strong
#>   stability: high
#>   method: categorical numeric screen
```

## Tune the Strength Tiers

Everything is configurable through
[`framedf_settings()`](https://gillescolling.com/framedf/reference/framedf_settings.md)
or the `...` of
[`frame()`](https://gillescolling.com/framedf/reference/frame.md):

``` r

frame(df,
      strong_threshold   = 0.6,
      moderate_threshold = 0.4,
      weak_threshold     = 0.15)
```

  practical examples (large data, repeated measures, observer effects).
- [Roles and rules](https://gillescolling.com/framedf/articles/roles.md)
  — what each role means and why some columns are excluded from
  screening.
